        <p>Latymer was established in 1624 on Church Street, Edmonton by bequest of Edward Latymer, a London City merchant in
        Hammersmith.[1] Although most of his wealth passed to the people of Hammersmith and the Parish of St Dunstan's (now
        Latymer Upper School), he named certain properties and estates to fund the education and livelihoods of "eight poore
        boies of Edmonton" with a doublet, a pair of breeches, a shirt, a pair of woollen stockings and shoes distributed
        biannually on Ascension Day and All Saints' Day. Pupils wore the red Latymer cross on their sleeve</p>
        <p>In 1662, John Wild of Edmonton made a bequest for the annual maintenance of a schoolmaster and a poor scholar at
        Cambridge. In 1697, Thomas Style extended the bequest to fund the education of "twenty poor boys ... Grammar and Latin
        tongue." Several similar benefactions produced about Â£550 per annum, which funded the instruction of more than one
        hundred boys, of which sixty were clothed. In 1811, Ann Wyatt, a widow from Hackney, willed her Navy Annuities for the
        construction and maintenance of a new school. The school-room was built in 1811 in accordance to her will.[2]</p>
        <p>The school did not take on Latymer's name for some centuries; when it finally did, it was known as Latymer's School. At
        some point, the apostrophe was dropped and the name modified to the Latymer School. It has been situated on its present
        site since 1910, when it also became coeducational.</p>
        <p>The school motto, Qui Patitur Vincit ('Who endures wins'), was also adopted in 1910 by Richard Ashworth, then
        headmaster. Prior to this, the motto was Palmam Qui Meruit Ferat ('Let he who bears the palm (of honour) deserve it').</p>
        <p>The school has formal links with St John's College, Cambridge (Edward Latymer's College) and Corpus Christi College,
        Cambridge (the College of Edward Latymer's father, William Latymer) which have endowments which may be used for the
        furtherance of the studies of former Latymer pupils at those colleges.</p>
        <p>In 1967 the school switched to a comprehensive intake as a result of Circular 10/65, a request from the Labour
        government to local education authorities to plan for conversion to a fully comprehensive education system. However, a
        certain amount of informal selection still took place in liaison with local primary schools.</p>
        <p>n 1988, Latymer took advantage of the Education Reform Act 1988 to become a Grant-Maintained school with selective
        entrance exams once more. Grant-maintained status was abolished by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and
        Latymer reverted to voluntary aided status.</p>
